      "question": "What is machine learning?",
      "options": [
        "A programming language",
        "B a type of artificial intelligence",
        "C a method of data analysis",
        "D a type of computer hardware"
      ],
      "correctAnswer": "B a type of artificial intelligence",
      "explanation": "Machine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that enables computers to learn from data without being explicitly programmed. It involves training algorithms on data to make predictions or decisions.",
      "hints": ["Machine learning is a subset of artificial intelligence", "It's used in many applications, such as image and speech recognition"]
    },
    {
      "type": "true/false",
      "question": "Machine learning models can only be trained on labeled data.",
      "options": ["True", "False"],
      "correctAnswer": "False",
      "explanation": "Machine learning models can be trained on both labeled and unlabeled data. Unlabeled data is often used for unsupervised learning, where the model learns patterns and relationships without a specific target output.",
      "hints": ["Unlabeled data can be used for clustering and dimensionality reduction", "Labeled data is used for supervised learning"]
    },
    {
      "type": "short-answer",
      "question": "What is overfitting in machine learning?",
      "options": [],
      "correctAnswer": "When a model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, making it poor at generalizing to new, unseen data.",
      "explanation": "Overfitting occurs when a model is too complex and tries to fit the noise in the training data, rather than the underlying patterns. This can lead to poor performance on new data.",
      "hints": ["Overfitting can be addressed by regularization techniques", "It's a common problem in machine learning"]
