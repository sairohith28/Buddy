      "question": "What is the difference between a token and a word in NLP?",
      "answer": "",
      "explanation": "In NLP, a token is a single unit of text, such as a word, punctuation mark, or special character. A word, on the other hand, is a sequence of characters that forms a unit of meaning. For example, 'hello' is a word, but 'hello!' is a token.",
      "hints": [
        "Think about the individual units of text that make up a sentence.",
        "Consider the difference between a word and a punctuation mark."

      "correct-answer": "A",
      "explanation": "NLP is a subfield of artificial intelligence that focuses on the interaction between computers and human language.",
